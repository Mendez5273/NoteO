Note-Taking Software that prioritizes productivity and automizes organization

As someone who learns lots and has ideas overflowing their brain constantly, I have found modern note-taking softwares are just not cutting it. Because of this, I decided to make my own. This will be done to aid my remaining two years of university. It will be tailored to my math/physics notes, prioritize features I love, and hopefully help organize my learning.
