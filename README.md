# NoteO
  Note-Taking Software that prioritizes productivity and automates organization

  As someone who learns constantly and has ideas overflowing their brain, I have found modern note-taking softwares just aern't cutting it. Because of this, I decided to make my own. This will be done to aid my remaining two years of university. Designed and tailored to my math/physics notes, prioritizing features I love, and hopefully help organize my learning. 

# Goals and features
---Terminal
  A terminal based note-taking software that abandons fancy ui's. These ui's are developed for ease of acess and broad public use, but I find all of the features and plus signs to create a folder just inhibit my productivity. I love a simple terminal, with easy file, directory, and navigation like linux. While I could use linux to make my notes, I also want them to be in their own dedicated environment where I can quickly click on them or see them. Therefore, this project is a mix of both worlds.
